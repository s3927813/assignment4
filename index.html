                    <div class="text">
                        <p> Hey there! I will pretend that you have not seen my name plastered on the whole website and
                            re-introduce myself. Hi! My name is Alicia or Alice for short! I am an 18-year-old student
                            studying
                            digital media design at RMIT. I have always had an interest in art and design since very
                            young.
                            Started from scribbling on my parent’s bedroom walls, tried sketching, painting, and now
                            experimenting on the digitals. I discovered various design platforms like Photoshop,
                            Illustrator,
                            Premiere, etc at the end of middle school and have been absolutely riveted by them since.
                            <br><br>
                            I tend to get heavily inspired by my own personal experiences mixed with different kinds of
                            art such
                            as movies and designs. I consider everything I have been through as tiny puzzle pieces that
                            creates
                            who I am and I constantly try to express that through my works. Thus, design has been an
                            outlet for
                            me to share my memories and relive my past experiences. Through design, I recognize more
                            about
                            myself and hopefully also help people discover more about themselves. In the future, I hope
                            to
                            exercise my design thinking and explore even more digital media design forms and techniques.

                    <hr>
                </h3>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <div class="center"><img style="justify-content: center;" src="img/video.png" alt="video remix image"
                            width="80%"></div><br><br>
                    <p style="color:white">My first assignment was to make a video remix using video (visual) and audio
                        from
                        2 different sources. The goal was to create a completely different video with a different
                        storyline
                        by combining the 2 by only using cuts and simple transitions in Premiere Pro. My entire working
                        process for this assignment consists of 3 main steps. First, I decided on a main concept, then
                        experimented with the videos and editing tools, and lastly construct a more specific storyline
                        as I
                        edit and pick out details to complete the videos.
                    </p><br>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left">Concept</h4>
                    <p style="color:white">Upon watching the video I chose for my visuals, I immediately thought of a
                        propaganda-ish concept about a town that seems perfect on the outside but has its own dark
                        hidden
                        secrets. I chose this theme because I wanted to take a different approach from the original
                        storyline. The video I chose for the visual was called New Town and it was about a town getting
                        overpopulated that they have to expand and move to a new town. While watching the video, I
                        noticed
                        that it has hints of dark vibes here and there, so I wanted to exaggerate the dark vibes from
                        the
                        original video and create a more ominous concept. Then I created a storyboard to build the
                        concept
                        into amore detailed storyline.
                        <div class="center"><img style="justify-content: center;" src="img/storyboard.png" alt="video remix image"
                            width="80%"></div>
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left">Experimentation</h4>
                    <p style="color:white">The first thing I did to approach this project was to watch each video
                        sources
                        and choose 2 video that stood out to me. With those 2 videos, I started creating a concept and
                        watched the visual video source multiple times. I imported them to Premiere and started by
                        cutting
                        up each scene and making folders separated by the overall mood or genre(dialogue, landscapes,
                        actions, etc) of each scene. <br>
                        I constructed the audio first and then scoured the folders to choose scenes that can work well
                        with
                        the audio. Just by experimenting, I saw that audio can really reshape a mood of a scene really
                        well
                        and change the whole meaning. So then I started experimenting by picking a few scenes from my
                        mood
                        folder and tried to make it into an opposite mood by just using fitting audios.
                        <br>After experimentation, I chose a key scene in my whole video which was to have a glitch
                        transition
                        juxtaposing the different sides of the town. So I constructed the glitch transition first by
                        cutting
                        up my video and audio into really short keyframes. Then, I compile them in a random order and
                        layered my audio.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h4 style="text-align:left">Finalization</h4>
                    <p style="color:white">I constructed the rest of the video based on the glitch scene. I mostly fixed
                        the sound as it was a big part that can keep audiences’ attention. I lowered parts of the audio
                        that sound unpleasantly loud and added some underlying background noises to set the mood even
                        more.

                    <hr>
                </h3>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <p style="color:white">For assignment 2, we were asked to create a website containing 9 icons that
                        emits a relating sound when clicked. We were also given a few theme options.
                        <br><br>
                        The main theme that I chose was “memory”, specifically childhood memories. At first, I had
                        considered three different themes, which are "growth", "memory", and "dream". I also was very
                        interested in jamais fu, which refers to a memory of something familiar but feels foreign to
                        you. But after much consideration, I chose to talk about childhood memories as it was a special
                        period for me, are easier to translate into simple icons, and often has a vibrant and fun color
                        scheme which I favor in general.
                        </p><br><br>

                        <p style="color:white">I did not know what colours to use when I initially made the thumbnail sketches. Following the
                        first three vector icon designs, I had a slight confusion with my initial ideas and present
                        icons at the time so I decided to express a little melancholy in the project, as childhood
                        memories are not just vibrant and fun, but also a bittersweet period in most people’s lives. I
                        applied a triadic colour scheme inspired by an artist I saw on a social media app, and played
                        with it in Illustrator to create a muted yet a bit saturated to bring the ‘old’ feeling into it.
                        I chose a triadic color palette because I find it to be the most vibrant and contrasting color
                        scheme whilst exploring on adobe colors.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img style="justify-content: center;" src="img/colpal.png" alt="video remix image"
                            width="70%"></div><br><br>

                        <p style="color:white">I first associated my theme of childhood memories with toys/games for the happy memories of that
                        time. After making a few sketches in frustration, I proceeded with a teddy bear and a swing
                        before my brain suddenly revved up and produced the rest of the icons. I went through many
                        processes of iteration especially in implementing the colors to each sketch. Due to the limited
                        amount of colors, I had to test a few versions to see which one looks best. In the process, I
                        also made a few changes to my sketch to unify them better with the other icons. Many of my
                        sketches for example the balloon popping also did not make it to the final 9 icons because I
                        feel like it is harder to translate into a flat design. I also considered that the sound would
                        be too similar to the ice cream icon (a pop and a sound of a child crying).
                        </p><br><br>

<div class="center"><img style="justify-content: center;" src="img/iteration.png" alt="video remix image"
                            width="70%"></div><br><br>

                        <p style="color:white">During the process, I just tried to work on other parts of the assignment like the html code and
                        sound until I get another idea for another icon. The hardest part here was to show a universal
                        experience through the icons I made, which initially are too personally related to myself.
                        There is no intentional order to go through the icons as they were placed according to how their
                        colours look with each other. However, to express the ups and downs of childhood, I deliberately
                        had happy and sad icons, 6 of the former and the rest is as is.
                        <br><br>
                        <p style="color:white">In the very last part of this project to insert the images into GitHub, I encountered a
                        painstaking problem of the page not showing anything at all. I could finally solve the issue
                        after 3 hours of web searching and asking my peers, in which I made a new branch for the images
                        folder then renamed my website. Although the process was confusing most of the time, I was quite
                        satisfied with the outcome, mainly because I was able to finish the project and loved how my
                            icons looked from a graphic design perspective.</p>

                </h3>
                <div class="panel2">
                    <p style="color:white">My third assignment was to create a 3d environment that is based on a
                        meaningful change in life. I decided to create an environment based on grief, specifically the
                        stages of grief I experienced in my life that brought a big impact for me. For this assignment,
                        a working prototype was especially crucial for my design process. Even though I tend to
                        experiment a lot and have my working prototype as more generalized and dynamic rather than
                        having detailed small steps, it is a key part for me to be able to work efficiently and not just
                        blindlessly creating and importing stuff without a general idea.
                        <br><br>
                        Working on a 3d project was very different from working on a 2d media. It is much harder to
                        control audiences’ attention because of the much bigger interactive space 3d media offers.
                        People can explore and interact with your work rather than just be an outsider ‘looking in’.
                        Thus in exchange, I also had to work harder to control my space so people have a direction of
                        where to look and where to go. One of the most interesting tools in Unity was the virtual
                        camera. The virtual camera allows you to pick a point of view to showcase your work, and for
                        this assignment, we all used a first person camera. The first person camera allows audiences to
                        explore firsthand as a ‘character’ inside the environment rather than someone ‘outside’ the
                        environment. This virtual camera lets people interact with the environment itself, different
                        from the role of the camera in assignment 1 which does not offer any control to the viewer. I
                        think the virtual camera is a really interesting tool because it grants audiences the experience
                        of being a part of the space.</p>

                        <div class="center"><img style="justify-content: center;" src="img/3d.png" alt="video remix image"
                            width="80%"></div>
                        <p style="color:white">One aspect that can help attract user’s attention in your space is sound. As per the other
                        assignments, sound plays a crucial part in setting the mood and attracting attention to an
                        object. In a 3d space, sound can be used in a three-dimensional way as well. We used the 360
                        sound feature in Unity to create a sound that interacts with distance (louder when you are near
                        the sound source and the other way around).
                        To unify the many different elements in my space, I used lighting, colors, and grass to blend
                        everything together. I used the terrain tool to create mountains to cover a different part of
                        the environment and created a pathway for users to follow. Having a same style of each 3d
                        objects are also important to unify my space and make everything look put together.
                        Along the design process, my concept evolved following each environment’s development. I did not
                        have a detailed idea of what kind of environment I wanted to do at first, but as I continued to
                        create the environment, the colors and little details I had not thought of before just popped in
                        my head.
                        <br><br>
                        The most frequent step I kept repeating in my working process was to playtest. Almost every time
                        that I added something new, I playtest after to see if everything looks unified and purposeful.
                        One of the examples are when I created the cave part of my environment. The cave was pretty
                        tricky because I have to add mesh planes around it to avoid the character falling out of the
                        world. Because of it’s textures, I have to playtest multiple times to see if I can walk out of
                        the cave properly. Another important thing I realized by playtesting is to see if the sizes of
                        each object make sense and contribute to the mood I am going for.
